# Restaurant Tip Splitter: A Python Billing Tool

## Overview
Welcome to the *Restaurant Tip Splitter*, a Python-based tool I built to simplify splitting restaurant bills with friends. Inspired by countless dinners where we struggled to calculate tips and divide costs, this script automates the process, making dining out stress-free and fair.

## Features
- *Input Validation*: Ensures robust handling of user inputs, preventing errors from invalid or negative values.
- *Accurate Calculations*: Computes the tip amount, total bill with tip, and per-person share with precision.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Presents a clear, receipt-style output for easy understanding.

## Installation
1. Ensure *Python 3.x* is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file.

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python: python restaurant_tip_splitter.py
2. Follow the prompts to enter the total bill amount, tip percentage, and number of    people.
3. The script will calculate and display the total amount including tip, and the amount each person needs to pay.

## Sample Output :
```

## Why I Built This
As someone new to programming, I wanted to tackle a real-world problem I encountered often. Splitting bills manually was tedious, and I saw an opportunity to apply my basic Python skills to create something practical. This project taught me about input validation, modular code design, and creating user-friendly outputs. I hope it helps others enjoy their dining experiences without the math hassle!
